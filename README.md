### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Jaewoo Shin.  
I'm a Web-focused Software Engineer with Factory Automation (FA) experience.

I specialize in web-based monitoring dashboards, real-time visualization, and history management systems  
connected to FA environments (PLC, Vision PC, MES).

My work focuses on building reliable, production-ready systems  
that actually run in manufacturing sites — not just demos.
