### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Jaewoo Shin.  
I'm a software engineer focused on web applications connected to Factory Automation (FA) environments.

I mainly build web-based monitoring dashboards, real-time visualization systems, and history management platforms
that are actually used in manufacturing sites.

My strength is combining web development with a solid understanding of FA data flow and on-site environments.
